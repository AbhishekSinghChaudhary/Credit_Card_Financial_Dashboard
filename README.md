# Credit_Card_Financial_Dashboard
Power bi Dashboard
Project objective:
In my credit_card_financial_dashboard project, I extract data from GitHub, load it into PostgreSQL, and create a database with a corresponding table. Then, I connect Power BI to PostgreSQL, importing and refining the data with DAX queries. Utilizing Power BI's visualization tools, I craft a dashboard with various charts, providing insights. Notably, I work with real-time datasets, ensuring updates in PostgreSQL reflect instantly in Power BI. Employing business analysis techniques, I focus on requirements elicitation, data profiling, and stakeholder interviews to align the dashboard with business objectives and drive actionable insights.
